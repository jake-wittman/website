Currently, I am a PhD candidate at the University of Minnesota! I'm near the end of my PhD and am starting my job search. I am hoping to find a position as a data scientist or data analyst where I can apply my extensive analytical skills. If you know of any opportunities or are recruiting, please reach out!

My research attempts to answer questions about the basic biology in invasive forest insect pests to help us better manage these pests. I do this through a combination of field and laboratory experiments. Specifically, my research for my PhD has focused on emerald ash borer, a small invasive beetle in North America that is killing our ash trees. I enjoy translating the results of my research into actionable information for land managers and other stakeholders that deal with invasive insects.

Early in grad school, I discovered I loved statistics and programming. Having access to the tools used to identify patterns in the noisy data we often work with in ecology was so enlightening! I sought out opportunities to learn more about statistics and ended up with a graduate minor in biostatistics (basically, almost all the coursework required for a MSc in biostatistics and no thesis component). I work at the intersection of ecology, entomology, and management. The data we collect is often messy and requires significant cleaning and thoughtful analysis, where my biostatistics background has come through in spades. I've applied my statistical abilities in my PhD to address some outstanding questions related to the management of emerald ash borer (see my [Projects](https://wittja01.github.io/website/projects.html) page for more).

I'm also very passionate about education. Before starting graduate school, I taught 7 - 12 grade science for two years. I've continued to seek out formal and informal education opportunities, ranging from working as a teaching assistant in undergraduate and graduate courses while in graduate school, volunteering at workshops, providing R stats advice to colleagues, and a little bit of private tutoring.

In my free time, I enjoy running, playing my trombone, video games, reading, hiking/camping, and working on small coding projects.
