Hello! This is my blog, I guess? I don't anticipate I will be blogging here often. I thought it would be useful, however, to have this set up in the event I do want to blog about stuff! While I'm here I'm going to test some of the R code functionality.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(avg_mpg = mean(mpg))
```

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, colour = cyl)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_viridis_c()
```
